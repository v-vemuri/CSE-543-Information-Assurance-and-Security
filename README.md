# Assignments

Week 3 - Caesar Cipher Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with basic encryption schemes and how to derive a decryption function from a known encryption function. Additionally, this assignment will familiarize you with Python (or the programming language you choose) and writing a simple decryption function in Python (or your programming language). You will learn how to read encryption code, deriving the corresponding decryption function (which is the inverse function of the encryption function), implementing the decryption function, and applying the decryption function on a given input string.

Week 3 - Esper Cipher Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you more with Python (or the programming language you choose) and writing a simple decryption function for a custom encryption routine. You will learn how to read encryption code, deriving the corresponding decryption function (which is the inverse function of the encryption function), implementing the decryption function, and applying the decryption function on a given input string.

Week 4 - TCP Spoofing Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with the most traditional type of TCP spoofing attack. You will learn how to create and use raw sockets, send raw IP packets with forged source IPs, manually establish TCP connections, and manually create TCP packets.

Attention: this software is actually not required to pass the assignment. A simple scapy command line query will suffice. This software may not work.

Week 4 - UDP Spoofing Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to make you feel comfortable with using a VPN connection and working directly with raw sockets.

Week 6 - Fuzz Them All Project

The purpose of this assignment is to test your understanding of fuzz testing (fuzzing) and guide you to develop your own binary fuzzer.
